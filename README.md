Final Project of Spring 2018 class, Game Engines, at UW-Stout.

## Project Description
For the final project of Game Engines we are completing a 21 part tutorial that goes over creating a 3rd-Person Battery Collector Power Up Game. Here is a link to the tutorial series, https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4/mSRov77hNR4.

### Software/Language
This is an Unreal Engines project using C++ and a little bit of the built in Unreal Blueprints.

### Progress
I am currently on video 0/21 for this project. So far I have not started anything, but progress will begin shortly.
